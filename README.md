# PyBer_Analysis
On the merge data from the “ride_data.csv" , "city_data.csv" data sets. I ‘ve made a group by type of city. From that dataset Total rides and total fares has counted, however Total drivers double counted so the Driver count has run on city data to get the correct numbers.
Based on the summery of the data rural and suburban has less amount in each category and as result the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver has higher price as a consequence of the less fares, rides and drivers. However, on Urban cities there are more numbers of rides, drivers and fares and that’s causes the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver to be lower.

Base on the total fare by city type graph the total fare is fairly flat thought the year and the total fare has been highest for urban and lowest for rural.
